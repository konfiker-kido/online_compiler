Here's a sample README file for your online compiler project, which uses React and Node.js. I've included instructions for users to add their credentials (client secret and ID) before using the app:

# Online Compiler

This is an online compiler built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It allows users to compile and run code in various programming languages directly in the browser.

## Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Compile and run code in various programming languages.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React for a seamless user experience.
- **Secure Execution**: Backend written in Node.js that processes the code execution.
- **Customizable**: Users need to add their credentials before using the compiler.

## Requirements

Before using the online compiler, you need to set up your credentials to connect to the necessary services.

### 1. Add Your Credentials

To start using the compiler, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-compiler.git
   cd online-compiler
   

   
Navigate to the backend folder:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  Add your credentials to the .env file. Make sure you replace the placeholders with your actual credentials
```



```bash
CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
 ```
Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed. Install the required dependencies:




 navigate to the frontend folder:

  ```bash

cd ../client
  ```
### Install the frontend dependencies:
  ```bash
npm install
 ```
Start the frontend server:

2. Compile Code
Once the app is running, you can use the frontend to write and compile code in various programming languages.

Select a programming language from the dropdown.
Write your code in the editor.
Click the "Run" button to compile and execute the code.
The output will be displayed below the editor.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React
Backend: Node.js
Code Execution: Use of third-party APIs or services to execute code (make sure to add the proper credentials for these services).
